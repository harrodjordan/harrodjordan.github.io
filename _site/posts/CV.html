<p><strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant, Laboratories of Dr. Lawrence Bonassar and Dr. Lara Estroff,</strong></p>

<p><em>Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering/Department of Materials Science and Engineering Cornell University, Ithaca, NY</em></p>

<p>May 2015 – Present</p>

<p>I aim to characterize and replicate the meniscal entheses, which attach the meniscal body to bone.</p>

<p>● Created meniscal enthesis constructs using trabecular bone cores containing mineralization gradients and tested tensile strength of constructs to determine the ideal demineralization profile for enthesis.</p>

<p>● Created custom MATLAB scripts to analyze the demineralization profile of partially demineralized trabecular bone cores.</p>

<p>● Established a standardized demineralization procedure for trabecular bone cores to further improve the mechanical properties of meniscal enthesis constructs.</p>

<p>● Analyzed microCT scans of demineralized bone experimental samples qualitatively by creating 3D renderings in Avizo Fire.</p>

<p>● Implemented histological techniques to compare protein localization and collagen fiber alignment in meniscal enthesis constructs to the native enthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Amgen Scholar, Laboratory of Dr. Lei Xing,</strong></p>

<p><em>Department of Radiation Oncology Stanford University, Stanford, CA</em></p>

<p>June 2017–August 2017</p>

<p>I aimed to develop a neural network that will identify artifacts in real-time MRI imaging.</p>

<p>● Developed a recurrent convolutional neural network to automate artifact identification in real-time MRI.</p>

<p>● Developed a deep convolutional neural network that automates aliasing artifact identification on MRI images.</p>

<p>● Developed Python algorithm to introduce aliasing motion artifacts in complex-valued MRI images.</p>

<p><strong>Biomarker Development Intern, Clinical and Translational Imaging Group,</strong></p>

<p><em>Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, NJ</em></p>

<p>May 2016 - August 2016</p>

<p>At Novartis, I aimed to more efficiently process Proof-of-Concept data for several pre-clinical drug trials using MATLAB, Spotfire, and Microsoft Office to prove their efficacy.</p>

<p>● Generated Proof-of-Concept data for several concurrent preclinical studies for transition to the next stage in FDA
approval.</p>

<p>● Analyzed optical coherence tomography images of intra-retinal fluids to determine drug efficacy on reduction of
fluid volumes in a clinical trial.</p>

<p>● Validated novel software that aimed to better visualize intra-retinal fluids using three-dimensional reconstructions and user-delineated fluid selections.</p>

<p>● Evaluated clinical trial data to determine systemic and local effects of a new topical analgesic treatment using Spotfire and Microsoft Excel visualization and data analysis techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Research Assistant, Biomaterials and Interface Tissue Engineering Lab,</strong></p>

<p><em>Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University, New York City, NY</em></p>

<p>March 2014 - July 2014</p>

<p>At Columbia, I aimed to determine whether nanofiber polymer scaffolds intended for use in drug delivery could withstand the mechanical stresses experienced by the periodontal ligament.</p>

<p>● Mapped tensile properties of nanofiber scaffolds to validate them as a replacement for native periodontal
ligamentous tissue.</p>

<p>● Electrospun polymer nanofiber scaffolds of different chemical compositions.</p>

<p>● Performed fluorescence assays on cell-seeded scaffolds to determine DNA content and cell viability.</p>

<p>● Performed mechanical testing to determine failure energies of polymer scaffolds and interpreted results using
MATLAB and Microsoft Excel.</p>
