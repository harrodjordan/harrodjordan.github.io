title:  Making a Chrissy Teigen Bot (Summer Project 1)
---

In addition to organizing the March for Science Student Summit (shameless plug - more information [here](https://harrodjordan.github.io/posts/ScienceYouthSummit )), I am trying my hand at a new machine learning project! I've never worked with natural language processing before, and wanted to learn about data mining, so I decided to make a program that creates tweets based on training data from a particular user. 

Initially, I wanted to use myself, but I needed a large enough dataset to even have a shot at generative realistic tweets. I also needed a user that was not likely to become... problematic (a la Microsoft's [super racist twitter bot](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist)). After a thorough search  (read: I opened Twitter and scrolled twice), I found the perfect person - Chrissy Teigen! 

So far, I've downloaded the tweets using the Tweepy API and done some light pre-processing to remove unncesessary metadata. I'm planning to pick a model over the next couple days, and will update this post as things happen! 

You can follow my progress on GitHub here:  https://github.com/harrodjordan/ItsChrissy

**Done**

* Learned to use Tweepy 

* Downloaded roughly 3000 tweets
