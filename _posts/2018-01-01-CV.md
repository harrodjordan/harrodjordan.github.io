## EDUCATION 

**Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA**

Incoming Ph.D. Student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics (Expected May 2024)

Concentration in Electrical Engineering 

*GEM Associate Fellow*

*Sigma Xi Society, Associate Member*


**Cornell University, College of Engineering, Ithaca, NY**

B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (Inagural Graduating Class, Expected: May 2018)

## RESEARCH 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant, Laboratories of Dr. Lawrence Bonassar and Dr. Lara Estroff,**

*Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering/Department of Materials Science and Engineering Cornell University, Ithaca, NY*

May 2015 – Present

I aim to characterize and replicate the meniscal entheses, which attach the meniscal body to bone.

● Created meniscal enthesis constructs using trabecular bone cores containing mineralization gradients and tested tensile strength of constructs to determine the ideal demineralization profile for enthesis.

● Created custom MATLAB scripts to analyze the demineralization profile of partially demineralized trabecular bone cores.

● Established a standardized demineralization procedure for trabecular bone cores to further improve the mechanical properties of meniscal enthesis constructs.

● Analyzed microCT scans of demineralized bone experimental samples qualitatively by creating 3D renderings in Avizo Fire.

● Implemented histological techniques to compare protein localization and collagen fiber alignment in meniscal enthesis constructs to the native enthesis.

**Amgen Scholar, Laboratory of Dr. Lei Xing,**

*Department of Radiation Oncology Stanford University, Stanford, CA*

June 2017–August 2017

I aimed to develop a neural network that will identify artifacts in real-time MRI imaging.

● Developed a recurrent convolutional neural network to automate artifact identification in real-time MRI.

● Developed a deep convolutional neural network that automates aliasing artifact identification on MRI images. 

● Developed Python algorithm to introduce aliasing motion artifacts in complex-valued MRI images.

**Biomarker Development Intern, Clinical and Translational Imaging Group,**

*Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, NJ*

May 2016 - August 2016

At Novartis, I aimed to more efficiently process Proof-of-Concept data for several pre-clinical drug trials using MATLAB, Spotfire, and Microsoft Office to prove their efficacy.

● Generated Proof-of-Concept data for several concurrent preclinical studies for transition to the next stage in FDA
approval.

● Analyzed optical coherence tomography images of intra-retinal fluids to determine drug efficacy on reduction of
fluid volumes in a clinical trial.

● Validated novel software that aimed to better visualize intra-retinal fluids using three-dimensional reconstructions and user-delineated fluid selections.

● Evaluated clinical trial data to determine systemic and local effects of a new topical analgesic treatment using Spotfire and Microsoft Excel visualization and data analysis techniques.

**Research Assistant, Biomaterials and Interface Tissue Engineering Lab,**

*Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University, New York City, NY*

March 2014 - July 2014

At Columbia, I aimed to determine whether nanofiber polymer scaffolds intended for use in drug delivery could withstand the mechanical stresses experienced by the periodontal ligament.

● Mapped tensile properties of nanofiber scaffolds to validate them as a replacement for native periodontal
ligamentous tissue.

● Electrospun polymer nanofiber scaffolds of different chemical compositions.

● Performed fluorescence assays on cell-seeded scaffolds to determine DNA content and cell viability.

● Performed mechanical testing to determine failure energies of polymer scaffolds and interpreted results using
MATLAB and Microsoft Excel.
