title: Call to Action - March for Science Youth Advocacy Summit!
---

This blog is still somewhat new, but I thought it would be a good place to put out a call to action to my friends and followers!

I'm working with the March for Science to organize the [Youth Advocacy Summit](http://www.marchforscience.com/studentsummit), which
will be July 6-8 in Chicago! We're nailing down session hosts as I type, but we are still looking for people to lead sessions or sit on panels 
on the following topics, so if you or someone you know is interested in hosting a session or sitting on a panel and lives in the Chicago area, please send me an 
email at jordan.b.harrod@gmail.com! The topics are listed below. 

The Summit is free for all attending students, so all of our funding is currently going to cover room reservations, equipment rentals, 
and other on-site costs associated with hosting the summit. Unfortunately, this means that we cannot compensate or reimburse session hosts. 
Because of this, those not from the Chicago area are welcome to host sessions as well, but should know that we cannot 
cover their expenses. Sorry!

**Technology Policy** - This will be a lecture that covers current topics in technology policy that students should be aware of, followed by a 
panel Q&A where students can ask questions about the topics covered. I am looking to cover artificial intelligence, data sharing, net neutrality, 
and other related topics.

**Health Policy** - This will be a lecture that covers current topics in health policy that students should be aware of, followed by a 
panel Q&A where students can ask questions about the topics covered. Anyone from public health policy-related fields is welcome - the topic for this 
panel is less defined given how broad the field is - although I'd definitely like to get some Medicare/Medicaid people. 

**Science in the Media** - This session is pretty open-ended. I think it would be cool to have science journalists come in to talk about their 
experiences in a Q&A, or discuss the different manifestations of science in media, but I'm open to other ideas. 

**Science and The Federal Budget**  - This session will give students an overview of how science fits into the federal budget, and how they can 
advocate for increased spending at different budgetary levels. Ideally, I'd like for this to be an interactive session with some budget allocation 
exercise for students to do in groups. 


Thank you again for reading this and spreading the word!
