# Current Projects

### March for Science - Youth Advocacy Summit 

I am working with the March for Science to plan a [Youth Advocacy Summit](https://www.marchforscience.com/studentsummit) in Chicago on July 7-8th, 2018! I will be organizing and moderating sessions focused on science communication and science education based on my experiences. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to partner with us to host a session! 

# Past Projects

### Cornell Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Society 

During my time at Cornell, I co-founded and was co-President of the Cornell Undergraduate BMES for a year and a half. Because I am a member of the inagural BME undergraduate class at Cornell, we did not have an existing society or community to be a part of, unlike other majors, so I decided to make one with some of my friends! We partnered with the BME Department and other organizations on campus to host professional development sessions, student panels on BME, recuiting efforts for Engineering Admissions, social events for current BMEs, and outreach opportunities in the local community. While I graduated in May 2018 and am no longer directly involved in the leadership, you can stay up to date with that Cornell BMES is doing on our [Facebook page](www.facebook.com/BMESCornell).
